A python bot 🤖 that uses the [Pyrogram API Framework](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) to take a list of Telegram channels and groups and joins them. I really made this to help people doing CTI and OSINT on Telegram to make growing your sock puppet accounts a lot easier.

A free Telegram account can be in 500 channels/groups max. A paid Telegram Premium account can be in 1000 channels/groups max.

You will first need to first log into https://my.telegram.org/ and grab your account api id and hash.

This bot takes a list of Telegram channels and groups like:

https://t.me/ButusovPlus

https://t.me/brigade_14

https://t.me/xaron14ombr

etc.

and joins your Telegram account to them.

I put a random delay in between joins of 35 seconds to 190 seconds just so you aint hitting rate limits and shit. If you try to join too many channels/groups at once it will timeout and make you wait. Slow and steady wins the race 🐢



Happy hunting and hacking my fellow CTI wizards 🧙‍♂️ 🎯
