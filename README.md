# Telegram-Channel-Joiner

A python bot that uses the [Pyrogram API Framework](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) to take a list of Telegram channels and groups and joins them. I really made this to help people doing CTI and OSINT on Telegram to make growing your sock puppet accounts a lot easier.

It takes a list of Telegram channels like:

https://t.me/ButusovPlus

https://t.me/brigade_14

https://t.me/xaron14ombr

etc.

and joins your Telegram account to them.

I put a random delay in between joins of 5 to 20 seconds just so you aint hitting rate litmits and shit.



Happy hunting and hacking!
