# Telegram-Channel-Joiner

A python bot that uses the [Pyrogram API Framework](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) to take a list of Telegram channels and groups and joins them.

It takes a list of Telegram channels like:
https://t.me/ButusovPlus
https://t.me/brigade_14
https://t.me/xaron14ombr
etc

and joins your Telegram account to them.

I put a random delay in between joins of 5 to 20 seconds just so you aint hitting rate litmits and shit.

Happy hunting and hacking!
